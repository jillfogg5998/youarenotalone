               My Story
            </h3>
    
      <p>
      I was born and raised into a close family. My parents were divorced, but both parents were in my life.  They were very supportive. I didn't do well in school. I never felt comfortable in my own skin.  I started smoking cigarettes and Marijuana when I was 14. I began drinking when I was 16.  I immediately for once in my life felt comfortable and like I belonged.  I manipulated my way into graduating high school.  Manipulation was a skill I learned early in age and it came in handy throuhout my years.  I got a job as a waitress.  During this time I began drinking heavily, sniffing cocaine and eventually smoking crack. I decided I didn't want to be a waitress for the rest of my life so I went to Cosmetology school. While in school, I started experimenting with pills. Mainly opiates and ecstasy. I became a daily user of opioid pills. Learning I had a physical dependancy, I went to my first detox. I felt so ashamed. I went to detox, a css, and meetings when I came home. It was all a lie. I was still using while telling everyone I was clean. I started getting into M.A.T.and using on top of it. I began to use intravenous drugs, mainly heroin and cocaine. Plenty more detoxes as well as being sectioned. I was a mess. Stealing from everyone in my family and any store. I was being arrested all the time. At one point I was clean from using drugs but started drinking heavily. I gave myself pancreatitis twice. On my way home from one of my trips to detox, I was in a horrible car accident. I was ejected 150ft. from a rolling car. I was rushed to trauma surgery with numerous injuries. upon awakening from a surgery, I learned my boyfriend was ejected as well but killed on impact. I had alcohol in my system so I was charged with vehicular homocide,dui,and negligence. Something had to change. I met a woman who brought me to my first A.A meeting. I instantly felt welcomed. It is there that I met my best friend. I had some relapses but got a sponsor and did some step work. My life hasn't been the same since. Currently I am serving one year (mandatory) and one year suspended sentence. I'm o.k. with that though. I went to jail a free woman. "Rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life"

   </h2>
   <ul>
      <li>
         <b>Methadone</b>
         <br>
         Methadone is a synthetic opiopid maintenence therapy in opioid dependance. While starting doses may be adjusted based on the amount of opioids reportedlyused, most clinical guidlines suggest doses start low(e.g.doses not exceeding 40mg daily) and are increments gradually.
         <br>
         <li>
            <b>Suboxone</b>
            <br>
            Suboxone(buprenorphine/naloxone) is used for medication-awssisted therapy(MAT)for opioid addiction. Suboxone works by tightly binding to the same receptors in the brain as other opiates, such as, heroin, morphinge, oxycodone. By doing so, it blunts intoxication with these other drugs, it prevents cravings, and it allows many people to traansition back from a life of relative normalcy and safety.
         </li>
         <br>
         <li>
            <b>Vivitrol</b>
            <br>
            Vivitrol(naltrexone) blocks the effects of opioids such as heroin or opioid pain medications. <b>DO NOT</b> try to overcome this blocking effect by taking larger amounts of opioids-this can lead to serious injury, coma, death. Vivitrol is a prescription injectable medicine used to: treat alcohol dependancies. You should stop drinking before starting Vivitrol. Vivitrol also prevents relapse to opioid dependancy <b>after</b> opioid detoxification.
